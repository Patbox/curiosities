# Curiosities
This mod adds bits and bops that I didn't think were worth into making separate mods. 
Inspired by other existing mods doing the same thing.

Similarly to other of my content mods, it is uses Polymer, allowing it to work fully server side, while being
playable with vanilla clients.

## Features:
- Phasing Blocks (and Phaser) - Blocks that when clicked or powered by redstone, vanish for 5 seconds. 
- Elevators - Move up and down by jumping / sneaking on them. They only move you to other elevators of the same colors.
  Can be dyed (via crafting) and have set facing direction (clicking on top of the block).
- Angel Block - Block that can be placed in air and drops directly into inventory when broken.
- Cross Rail - Rail block that allows Minecarts to pass in both directions.
- Invisible Pressure Plate - Well, that's clear isn't it?
- Bucket of Slime - A small Slime stored in a bucket. When held in hand also works as slime-chunk detector.
- Crafting Slate - Crafting Table on a stick. Use it to open portable crafting interface.
